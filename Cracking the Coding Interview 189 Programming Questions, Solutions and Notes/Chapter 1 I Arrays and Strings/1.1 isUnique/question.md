Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

Notes :

Sure, here are the possible approaches to determine if a string has all unique characters in C++:

**Brute Force Approach**

This is the simplest approach, and it works by comparing each character in the string with all the other characters in the string. If any two characters are equal, then the string does not have all unique characters.

```c++
bool is_unique_brute_force(const string& str) {
  for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < str.length(); j++) {
      if (str[i] == str[j]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

**Hash Table Approach**

This approach uses a hash table to store the characters in the string. The hash table maps each character to a unique integer value. This allows us to quickly check if a character has already been seen in the string.

```c++
bool is_unique_hash_table(const string& str) {
  unordered_map<char, int> char_map;
  for (char c : str) {
    int count = char_map[c];
    if (count > 0) {
      return false;
    } else {
      char_map[c] = 1;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

**Bit Manipulation Approach**

This approach uses bit manipulation to store the characters in the string. Each character is represented by a single bit. If the bit is set, then the character has been seen in the string.

```c++
bool is_unique_bit_manipulation(const string& str) {
  int bit_vector = 0;
  for (char c : str) {
    int bit = 1 << (c - 'a');
    if ((bit_vector & bit) != 0) {
      return false;
    } else {
      bit_vector |= bit;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

**Notes for revision**

* The brute force approach is the simplest to implement, but it is also the least efficient.
* The hash table approach is more efficient than the brute force approach, but it requires additional space.
* The bit manipulation approach is the most efficient approach, but it is also the most difficult to implement.

Which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If space is not a concern, then the hash table approach is a good choice. If space is a concern, then the bit manipulation approach is a good choice. If simplicity is important, then the brute force approach is a good choice.

Here is a table that summarizes the time and space complexity of the three approaches:

| Approach | Time complexity | Space complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Brute force | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Hash table | O(n) | O(n) |
| Bit manipulation | O(n) | O(1) |
